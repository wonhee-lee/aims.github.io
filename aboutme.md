Dr. Won Hee Lee is a postdoctoral fellow of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in Biomedical Engineering from Kyung Hee University, Republic of Korea, in 2006 and 2008, respectively. He received the Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Columbia University in 2014. He worked in the Heffner Biomedical Engineering Imaging Laboratory at Columbia University and jointly worked in the Division of Brain Stimulation and Therapeutic Modulation in the Columbia Psychiatry Department as well as in the Brain Stimulation and Neurophysiology Division in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Duke University Medical Center. He is particularly interested in advancing our understanding of the mechanism underlying neural circuitry abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders and in investigating the role of brain network dysregulation in psychiatric disorders using multimodal neuroimaging modalities in combination with brain stimulation techniques.
