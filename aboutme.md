## Employment

I will be joining my alma mater, Kyung Hee University as an Assistant Professor of Software Convergence in September 2020. I am currently an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA.

## Education

I received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in Biomedical Engineering from Kyung Hee University, Republic of Korea, in 2006 and 2008, respectively. I received the Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Columbia University in 2014. I worked in the Heffner Biomedical Engineering Imaging Laboratory at Columbia University and jointly worked in the Division of Brain Stimulation and Therapeutic Modulation in the Columbia Psychiatry Department as well as in the Brain Stimulation and Neurophysiology Division in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Duke University Medical Center. 

## Research Interests

My research spans a range of biological and medical research challenges that are data intensive and focused on the creation of novel methodologies to advance biomedical science discovery. I work with multidisciplinary teams and engage in data-driven translational research to develop algorithms for data analysis and software as digital biomarkers that help aid in diagnostics and decision making in patient care. 
My research can be characterized using four keywords: 
### Biomedical Data Analysis 
I am interested in innovative statistical signal and image processing algorithms for large-scale data analysis. 
### Artificial Intelligence
I am creating scalable and accurate artificial intelligence algorithms based on machine learning, deep learning and data mining. 
### Computational Modeling and Simulation
I am using and developing computational approaches for large-scale brain dynamics that can help take advantage of large data sets, categorizing brain dysfuntion with novel methods to lead to better diagnoses and improved biomarkers.
### Network Neuroscience
I am analyzing multimodal neuroimaging data to understand integrative aspects of brain structure and function, specifically how the connections and interactions among brain regions produce brain dynamics, cognition, behavior, and disease.
### Intelligent Healthcare
I am aiming at discovering knowledge and wisdom in precision medicine, and data-driven digital healthcare.
