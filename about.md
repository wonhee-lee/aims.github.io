Our mission is to develop algorithms and models to improve medicine for patients and healthcare professionals.

Our aim is to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques for the analysis and interpretation of natural language, biomedical and health data. The group focuses on pursuing blue-sky research, including:

* AI for the early detection, prediction and diagnosis of diseases
* AI for personalized interventions and therapies
* AI for the identification of new biomarkers and targets for therapy
* Safe, robust and interpretable AI approaches
* Privacy-preserving AI approaches

Our group uses neuroimaging, speech and text communication, and machine learning to improve assessments and treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders. To support this effort, we build frameworks and use extensive collaborations to improve efficiency of analyses and reproducibility in science.

The Lab for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Science - AIMS is an interdisplinary group of machine learning engineers, medical doctors and scientists. We use artificial intelligence , here mostly machine learning methods, to tackle various use cases in medicine. We work with pure clinical data, with neuroimaging data, the combination of both and also with speech and text data. 

We have particularly strong interest in the application of neuroimaging and computing technology to improve the understanding brain development (in-utero and ex-utero), to improve the diagnosis and stratification of patients with psyhicatric disorders. 

We use state-of-the-art methods of machine learning such as artificial neural nets and boosted tree algorithms. A special focus of our research is xAI - explainable AI. These methods allow to open the "black box" of machine learning and to understand how AI makes its decisions. This is especially important in the field of medicine. 

Artificial intelligence is a key technology in computer science, the success of which continues to spread and is by no means limited to computer science and mathematics. Also in medicine, it is assumed that artificial intelligence will change medical research and medical care in the long term.

The goal of this course (Wahlpflichtmodul M24) is to familiarize medical students with this new technology, in particular to jointly work out basic concepts of machine learning, to reduce possible resistance to programming, to demonstrate various applications in medical research (from drug development to brain imaging for neurological diseases) and to critically assess them with regard to practical, legal and ethical aspects.


Our mission is to improve human health, through the development of artificial intelligence methods. Most of these problems come back to the question of why things happen or how they change, so we focus on causal inference and time series data. We look at both clinical data as well as data generated outside of hospitals and aim to support both medical providers and patients in their decision making. Key application areas include stroke and diabetes. We are also working on devices that can automatically measure food intake, using body-worn sensors.
