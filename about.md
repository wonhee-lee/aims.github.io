Our mission is to advance scholarship and education for the quantitative and computational analysis of biomedical and health data and to unite and promote Biomedical Informatics and Biostatistics as essential disciplines for the mentoring and academic development of faculty and the training and education of the next generation of data. 

A world where your data transforms not just your health, but the health of people everywhere. Where doctors instantly search millions of medical records to find what worked for patients just like you. Where new drugs are developed — and new uses are identified for existing drugs — at rapid speeds.  Where we can finally predict diseases in both people and populations and prevent illness before it even occurs. By harnessing the power of large-scale computing and data analysis, we’ll make this world a reality.
