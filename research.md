## Research Interests

Our research spans a range of biological and medical research challenges that are data intensive and focused on the creation of novel methodologies to advance biomedical science discovery. We work with multidisciplinary teams and engage in data-driven translational research to develop algorithms for data analysis and software as digital biomarkers that help aid in diagnostics and decision making in patient care. 
Our research can be characterized using the following keywords: 
### Biomedical and Health Data Analysis 
We are interested in innovative statistical signal and image processing algorithms for large-scale data analysis. 
### Artificial Intelligence
We are creating scalable and accurate artificial intelligence algorithms based on recent breakthroughs in machine learning, deep learning and data mining. 
### Artificial Emotional Intelligence
We are interested in artificial emotional intelligence, also known as emotions analytics or affective computing, uses software to analyze a human's verbal and non-verbal communication and determine the personâ€™s emotional or psychological state.
### Network Neuroscience
We are analyzing multimodal neuroimaging data to understand integrative aspects of brain structure and function, specifically how the connections and interactions among brain regions produce brain dynamics, cognition, behavior, and disease.
### Healthcare Language Processing
We are extracting healthcare information from medical text for (a) medical concepts (medication, procedures and medical conditions), (b) functional features (temporal relationships, subjects, and certainty assessments), and (c) relations (side effects and medication dosage). 
### Computational Neuroimaging
We are using and developing computational approaches for large-scale brain dynamics that can help take advantage of large data sets, categorizing brain dysfuntion with novel methods to lead to better diagnoses and improved biomarkers.
### Intelligent Healthcare
We are aiming at discovering knowledge and wisdom in precision medicine, and data-driven digital healthcare.
