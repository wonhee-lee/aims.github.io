## Research Interests

Our research spans a range of biological and medical research challenges that are data intensive and focused on the creation of novel methodologies to advance biomedical science discovery. We work with multidisciplinary teams and engage in data-driven translational research to develop algorithms for data analysis and software as digital biomarkers that help aid in diagnostics and decision making in patient care. 
Our research can be characterized using the following keywords: 
### Biomedical Data Analysis 
We are interested in innovative statistical signal and image processing algorithms for large-scale data analysis. 
### Artificial Intelligence
We are creating scalable and accurate artificial intelligence algorithms based on machine learning, deep learning and data mining. 
### Computational Modeling and Simulation
We are using and developing computational approaches for large-scale brain dynamics that can help take advantage of large data sets, categorizing brain dysfuntion with novel methods to lead to better diagnoses and improved biomarkers.
### Network Neuroscience
We are analyzing multimodal neuroimaging data to understand integrative aspects of brain structure and function, specifically how the connections and interactions among brain regions produce brain dynamics, cognition, behavior, and disease.
### Intelligent Healthcare
We are aiming at discovering knowledge and wisdom in precision medicine, and data-driven digital healthcare.
